# Apache Maven

Apache Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of information.

Therefore, Maven will help us to manage the project and import all useful libraries and plugins (i.e reporting, cucumber) to run the framework smoothly.

- I've already created the POM file, so simply copy and paste or clone the pom.xml file [here](https://github.com/AngeloFrog07/E-Commerce-project---Cucumber-automation-framework/blob/master/pom.xml)
  
  The file contains the following dependencies:
   cucumber-java - 1.2.5 
   cucumber-junit 1.2.5
   selenium-java 2.53.0
   testng 6.9.9
   cucumber-testng 1.2.5
   cucumber-reporting 3.8.0
   
  and plugins:
    maven-compiler-plugin 3.6.1
    maven-surefire-plugin 2.20
    maven-cucumber-reporting 3.8.0
